/* ===========================================================================
 * sw.js
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * The service worker. Published at the root of the site so its scope covers
 * the landing page and both book directories.
 *
 * What it is for
 * --------------
 * A reader on a phone in a field station, on a bus, or on hotel wifi that
 * works for ten seconds in every thirty. Chapters they have already opened
 * should still open. That is the whole ambition; this is not an offline
 * download of the book, and it does not pretend to be.
 *
 * The strategy, and why each part is what it is
 * --------------------------------------------
 *   Pages, network first. A chapter is prose that gets corrected. A reader
 *   with a connection should see today's version, not the one they happened
 *   to open a month ago. If the network fails, the cached copy answers, and
 *   if there is no cached copy, the offline page explains why rather than
 *   letting the browser show its dinosaur.
 *
 *   Assets, cache first then refresh in the background. Stylesheets, scripts,
 *   images and fonts are content addressed in practice: when they change,
 *   the page that needs them changes too. Serving them from cache is what
 *   makes a revisit feel instant.
 *
 *   Cross origin, untouched. Plotly comes from a CDN and Pyodide is about ten
 *   megabytes. The browser's own HTTP cache handles both, and putting them in
 *   here would mean managing a cache the size of the runtime for a feature a
 *   reader may never use. Requests that are not same origin pass straight
 *   through.
 *
 * Failure has to be survivable. Every handler falls back to the network, and
 * a caching error is logged rather than thrown: a site that breaks because
 * its offline layer broke is worse than a site with no offline layer.
 * =========================================================================== */
