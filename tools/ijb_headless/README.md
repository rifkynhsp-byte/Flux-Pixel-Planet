# IJB headless runner

Runs modules of the IJB app (its Earth Engine source) outside the Code Editor, so the
book can show results produced by the app's own code (chapter P6).

    npm install @google/earthengine
    IJB_SRC=/path/to/ijb/source node harness.js job.json

A job names the module and its function, the area, and the values to type, then presses the
module's button. Example (Banjir, Demak 2024):

    {"module": "disaster", "fn": "flood",
     "aoi": {"collection": "FAO/GAUL/2025/level2", "field": "GAUL2_NAME", "value": "Demak"},
     "level": "Kabupaten", "textboxes": ["2024-02-01", "2024-02-29", "2024-03-14", "2024-03-24"],
     "out": "banjir_demak_2024.json"}

The output holds the metric cards and the serialised Earth Engine object of every map layer;
`scripts/py/ch00g_ijb_cases.py` draws them. Authentication uses a service-account key at
`~/.config/fullstack-rs/ee-key.json` (never commit a key).
